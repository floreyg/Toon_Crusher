# 🧼 Toon_Crusher: Genre Filter for Jellyseerr

Toon_Crusher is a lightweight, tag-based filtering script designed to enhance personal media discovery in Jellyseerr and Jellyfin stacks. Built for estate-grade sanity and genre control, it empowers users to:

- ❌ Automatically exclude unwanted genres (like *Animation* or *Reality*) from requestable content.
- 🧠 Use TMDB tags and metadata to dynamically filter search results.
- 🐳 Integrate with Dockerized media stacks for seamless deployment.
- 🐾 Preserve family harmony by steering the kids away from yet another Pokémon movie.

Ideal for multigenerational households, obsessive curators, and anyone trying to tame the TMDB jungle.
